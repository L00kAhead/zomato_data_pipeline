# 🍽️ Zomato Data Pipeline Project

This project implements a multi-layered data architecture in Snowflake using the Medallion Architecture Bronze–Silver–Gold layers. The data is ingested from raw CSV into Snowflake, transformed into a star schema (Silver layer), and finally exposed as secure curated views (Gold layer) for analytics and BI consumption.
